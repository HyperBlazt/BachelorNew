@article{Blum2007,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe a pilot summer workshop (CS4HS) held at Carnegie Mellon University in July 2006 for high school CS teachers to provide compelling material that the teachers can use in their classes to emphasize computational thinking and the many possibilities of computer science. Diversity and broadening participation was explicitly addressed throughout the workshop. We focused on broadening the image of what CS is -- and who computer scientists are -- since the reasons for under- representation in the field are very much the same as the reasons for the huge decline in interest. We describe the design of the workshop along with results from initial surveys and evaluations. Short-term evaluations show that this workshop was successful in changing the perception of CS for these teachers and giving them the impetus to include broader topics in their programming courses for the upcoming school year. Future surveys will track the long-term effect of this workshop.},

@article{Kafai2006,
	Abstract = {This article presents an overview of what we know about two perspectives, coined $\backslash$ninstructionist and constructionist, to games for learning. The instructionists, accustomed $\backslash$nto thinking in terms of making instructional educational materials, turn naturally to the $\backslash$nconcept of designing instructional games.Far fewer people have sought to turn the tables: $\backslash$nby making games for learning instead of playing games for learning. Rather than embed- $\backslash$nding ``lessons'' directly in games, constructionists have focused their efforts on providing $\backslash$nstudents with greater opportunities to construct their own games---and to construct new $\backslash$nrelationships with knowledge in the process. Research has only begun to build a body of $\backslash$nexperience that willmake us believe in thevalue of playing andmakinggamesfor learning.},
